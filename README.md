# Quiz Buzzer
Simple QuizBuzzer System Using Arduino UNO

Components Used :
-  Arduino UNO (Doesn't matter, any arduino based board will work)
-  LED - 3
-  Resistor (220 Ohm) - 3
-  Push Button switch - 4
-  Buzzer - 3
-  Connecting wires


A JSON file for online (wowiki) simulation is also included(so you can copy paste it into wowiki's diagram editor).
But Connections are as follows.



Connections :
-  pin 2 => button1 => ground
-  pin 3 => button2 => ground
-  pin 4 => button3 => ground

-  pin 5 => buzzer1 => ground
-  pin 6 => buzzer2 => ground
-  pin 7 => buzzer3 => ground


-  pin 8 => led1 => 220Ω resistor => ground
-  pin 9 => led1 => 220Ω resistor => ground
-  pin 10 => led1 => 220Ω resistor => ground

-  pin 11 => mButton => ground



Note - 
-  mButton is for Quiz Master.
-  You can add as many buttons as you want.
-  Just declare them as button# (replace # with button number).
-  Copy paste the answer# (# indicates a number) function and replace the numbers with newly created number in code.
